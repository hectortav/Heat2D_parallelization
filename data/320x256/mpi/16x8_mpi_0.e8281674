--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[42048,0],0] on node wn028
  Remote daemon: [[42048,0],9] on node wn037

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
